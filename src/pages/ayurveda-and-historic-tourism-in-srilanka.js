          <p>Tourism has evolved to become more than simply a stream of foreign revenue that contributes to the economy of a country. Apart from the traditional tourists who visit the established tourist sites, the younger generation of tourists has found places oﬀ the beaten track stimulating economic growth in areas previously not internationally popular.</p>
          <p>The growth of Ella and Mirissa as a tourist destination in Sri Lanka in recent years is primarily due to the younger generation of ‘backpacking’ tourists and their use of modern social media platforms such as Instagram. Eco-tourism is another such deviation from the standard tourist experience that has become popular amongst all age groups, where the focus is more on experiencing and conserving the natural beauty a country has to oﬀer.</p>
          <p>Another aspect of tourism that has grown across the world is holistic tourism, where visitors focus on truly experiencing the unique culture of a destination and seek ways to enhance the understanding of themself through their tourism activities. As a result of this, experiences such as homestays have grown in popularity, where tourists are able to be more immersed in the culture and unique experiences a country has to oﬀer.</p>
          <p>In this aspect, Sri Lanka is home to one of the oldest forms of alternative medicines, ‘Hela Wedakama’ which traces its origins back to Ayurveda.‘Hela Wedakama’ is an ancient medicinal practice developed over centuries by kings, passed down from generation to generation and is popular among locals due to its eﬀectiveness in treating a wide range of ailments. These forms of lifestyle and medicinal treatment have experienced a spike in interest across the globe due to their widespread beneﬁts.</p>
          <p>Adithya Ayurveda is one such ayurvedic and Sri Lankan traditional medicinal practice, spearheaded by one of the best Ayurvedic heart consultants in the country Dr. Sarath S. Gunawardhana. Dr. Gunawardhana is a pioneer in the ﬁeld of Ayurveda in Sri Lanka and has developed his own treatments for various conditions over the course of his illustrious career.</p>
          <p>Based in Anuradhapura, an ancient kingdom of Sri Lanka for over a millennium, Adithya Ayurveda is an ideal destination for those wanting a truly Sri Lankan experience. Located in close proximity to many of Sri Lanka’s major cultural and heritage sites, Anuradhapura itself is widely considered to be the cultural capital of Sri Lanka. At Adithya, guests have many wellness and health treatment options that are administered alongside activities such as yoga and meditation, making it an ideal destination for those seeking a spiritual awakening as well as attaining mental and physical wellbeing during their holiday in Sri Lanka.</p>
