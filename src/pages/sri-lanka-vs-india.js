      <p>The biggest difference between Ayurveda in Sri Lanka and India is that Sri Lanka developed its own Ayurveda system. The Ayurvedic practice blended with the island's local natural medicine practiced since ancient times. Old stone inscriptions document the medical services in Sri Lanka.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>This is particularly evident in a more refined massage technique, e.g. in India the foot massage is only carried out up to the ankle, in Sri Lanka up to the knee.</li>
                <li>Basically, there are some small differences between Ayurveda cures in India and Sri Lanka: Acupuncture, acupressure, sometimes reflexology, often herbal saunas and flower baths are part of cures in Sri Lanka, less often in India.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, herbal laxatives, indigenous herbs that grow in Sri Lanka, are used to produce Ayurvedic preparations. Ayurvedic treatments usually end with a herbal bath or herbal steam bath.</li>
                <li>Originally the Shiradhara (forehead shower) in India was performed with cow's milk, the Shirodhara in Sri Lanka with oil from the very beginning</li>
                <li>In India, a lot of cooking is done with cow's milk, in Sri Lanka only coconut milk is used. A great benefit for all guests with
                        Lactose intolerance.</li>
                <li>In Sri Lanka, Ayurveda has long enjoyed greater recognition and more committed government support than in India, despite the fact that it is an ancient Indian natural healing method. It is the only country in the world that offers Ayurveda as a complete state health system.</li>
                <li>The training of doctors in Sri Lanka includes Ayurveda topics in addition to western medicine. Today, Ayurveda Medical manages and controls
                        Body governing the registration of physicians, the rules of procedure, ethics and conduct. The Ministry of Health controls the Department of Ayurveda, which is headed by the Commissioners for Ayurveda, the Ayurveda Medicine Cooperation and the Ayurveda Research Institute.</li>

      <p>Another advantage for Sri Lanka is that tourism on the island has a tradition:
            Hotel and resort owners have long experience with Western customers and their needs. They are more open and more experienced in European behavior. In most hotels we find an environment in which one feels comfortable. The standard of accommodation is significantly higher than in India.</p>

       <p>In many Ayurveda hotels, the psyche of the guests is being addressed more and more. The Ayurveda doctors in Sri Lanka are more open to other healing methods and in the meantime some resorts even offer combinations with Ayurveda and individual coaching or Ayurveda, pranic healing, yoga and coaching.</p>

        <p>Sri Lanka is an agricultural country and herbal medicine is not contaminated. In addition, the medicinal herbs (medicine in general, through the influence of the indigenous natural healers) are said to have a stronger effect in Sri Lanka.</p>
        
        <p>In Sri Lanka, more is explained about the cure than in India, the doctors are happy to explain the background of therapeutic measures to guests.</p>
        
        <p>While in India a strict diet plan is usually to be followed and instructions are given for the organization of the daily routine, this topic is viewed more loosely in Sri Lanka.</p>
      
        <p>The traditional Ayurvedic cuisine resembles a gluten-free, vegan diet. However, this is rarely found in Sri Lanka.
            It's cleaner, not quite as crowded and heavily populated as India.</p>

        <p>The climate is largely humane with an average of 26-29 degrees, not as hot and humid as in India in the rainy season and therefore an Ayurveda cure is possible all year round.</p>
        
        <p>Most Ayurveda resorts can be found on the west and south coasts. The travel months from November to April are the high season in Sri Lanka. Inexpensive Ayurveda treatments are offered in the low season from May to October.</p>
       
        <p>Due to the Buddhist character of the country, Sri Lanka is completely unproblematic for women traveling alone, in contrast to India.</p>
        
        <p>Last but not least, the radiant people of Sri Lanka are unique.</p>
